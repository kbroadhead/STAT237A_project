# STAT237A_project

This repository contains the final project paper completed for the STAT 237A Time Series Analysis course at UC Davis. Thanks to Xuezhen Li, my partner for this project.

From the abstract: "In this paper, we consider using google trends search data to predict current, but presently unknown values, of time series data of interest. Two examples are discussed, an economic example involving automobile sales, and a public health example involving seasonal flu data collected from the CDC. Potential benefits and  imitations of this method of “forecasting the present” are also discussed."
